# mbot2-sim

A browser-based digital twin of the **Makeblock mBot 2 (CyberPi)** with a drag-and-drop block editor that mirrors the **Open Roberta Lab** toolbox. Students write programs in the browser, run them on a 2D simulated course, and then recreate the same program in Open Roberta Lab to flash to real hardware.

## What it is

A static, client-side web application that gives Portuguese-speaking robotics classrooms a sandboxed environment to test mBot 2 programs before deploying to hardware. The block editor is visually and structurally compatible with Open Roberta Lab's mBot 2 toolbox (Beginner + Expert levels, all in PT-PT). Programs execute inside [JS-Interpreter](https://github.com/NeilFraser/JS-Interpreter) against a 2D physics simulation with differential-drive kinematics, ultrasonic raycasting, quad-RGB colour sensing, and PNG-based arena maps.

## What it is NOT

- **Not a full Open Roberta replacement.** Only the mBot 2 block subset is implemented. Logic, math, text, list, and variable blocks are stock Blockly; Open Roberta's full language list is not replicated.
- **Not a hardware bridge.** There is no code path from this simulator to real mBot 2 hardware. Use Open Roberta Lab for that.
- **Not multi-robot.** The simulator runs a single robot. Communication blocks use a local pub/sub stub.
- **Not account-aware.** There is no backend, no login, no cloud save. Everything is client-side; programs auto-save to `localStorage`.

## Features

- Open Roberta Lab toolbox (Beginner + Expert) cloned in European Portuguese (PT-PT)
- All locomotion, audio, display, LED, sensor, control-flow, math, text, list, and communication blocks implemented
- 2D differential-drive physics at 60 fps (differential drive, axis-separated collision)
- 3-ray ultrasonic cone raycast (15° aperture) against obstacle pixels
- Quad-RGB colour sensor (4 sub-sensors) with 8-colour palette + brightness + line-code
- PNG-based map system with automatic spawn-point detection (cyan/yellow markers)
- Map catalogue: drop PNGs in `public/maps/`, auto-discovered at build/dev time
- Pan and zoom canvas navigation (mouse wheel + drag)
- Save/load programs as Blockly XML; last session auto-restored from `localStorage`
- Pure static site — no backend, no API keys, no environment variables

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

Node 18 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USER/mbot2-sim.git
cd mbot2-sim
npm install
npm run dev          # dev server at http://localhost:5173
```

### Production build

```bash
npm run build        # outputs to dist/
npm run preview      # preview the built site locally
```

The `dist/` directory is a self-contained static site ready to deploy anywhere.

### Hosting

**Netlify drop:** drag the `dist/` folder onto [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop). Done.

**Cloudflare Pages:** connect the GitHub repo; set build command `npm run build` and output directory `dist`.

**GitHub Pages:** use the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) package or the GitHub Actions workflow below.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for full deployment details and map-update workflow.

## Adding maps

Drop PNG files into `public/maps/` before building. The Vite plugin scans the directory at dev-server start and at build time, writing a `catalogue.json` that the app reads. Maps are auto-discovered — no code changes needed.

See [docs/MAP_AUTHORING.md](docs/MAP_AUTHORING.md) for the full authoring guide: reserved colours, spawn markers, obstacle painting, and dimension constraints.
